Integrity-Driven Health Diplomacy
A field-tested model for acting with integrity where systems stall.

Overview
Integrity-Driven Health Diplomacy was born where epidemics crossed borders faster than permission. Forged over 40 years in 34 countries, it’s a framework for acting with clarity when institutions stall and risk is no longer optional. From smallpox in India to HIV stigma in Senegal and corruption in the DRC, this model defines how to lead without waiting. It replaces hesitation with strategic defiance — grounded in field-tested moral judgment. This isn’t theory; it’s the blueprint for showing up when systems collapse.

Framework

Diagnose System Paralysis
Recognize when bureaucracy, fear, or hierarchy are delaying action — and name it without flinching.

Act with Integrity Where Others Won’t
Cross borders, enter councils, speak with religious elders — even when policy says don’t. Lead by presence, not position.

Deliver Trust in Crisis Zones
Containment isn’t enough. Build local trust in global systems by acting decisively, visibly, and with moral clarity.

Leave a System Behind, Not Just a Signature
Your measure isn’t the project. It’s the new standard others follow after you go. Shift culture, not just outcomes.

Proof of Impact

Prevented the re-entry of smallpox into West Bengal by crossing an international border to investigate an unreported case — and triggering containment before reinfection could spread.

Led emergency evacuations during Ethiopia’s civil war: evacuating UN staff and families from her organization, navigating between warring factions to rescue an injured child and secure his airlift to Nairobi, and obtaining the release of a detained WHO staff member from the new rebel government for evacuation to Geneva.

Convened the first AIDS & Religion conference in Africa — learning Wolof to engage Islamic Brotherhood leaders directly, transforming stigma into compassion and launching faith-aligned HIV prevention across Senegal.
